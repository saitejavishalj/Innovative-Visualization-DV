# Innovative Visualization Design

Created a unique visualization that goes beyond the "common chart types" that you already exist.

The audience for this visualization is visitors to a musuem. The goal is to communicate certain aspects of the data effectively and in a creative manner, as opposed to supporting in-depth analysis such as might be done by domain experts.

There are two datasets available for this project (choose one).

* Soviet space dogs ([souce](https://airtable.com/universe/expG3z2CFykG1dZsp/sovet-space-dogs?explore=true)): This dataset contains two tables.
    * Dogs: 48 dogs who participated in the Soviet space program in the 1950s and 1960s.
    * Flights: 42 missions that the dogs flew on.
* Burritos in San Diego ([source](https://www.kaggle.com/srcole/burritos-in-san-diego)): This dataset contains a single table that lists several ratings of ~200 burritos from ~50 restaurants in San Diego.

## Requirements

* Created a page `index.html` in this repostory for storing your visualization.
* Created a unique D3 visualization that is not simply an existing technique or D3 block. 
* Visualized minimum of following three different attributes. 
    * At least one quantatitive and one categorical attribute.
    * If chosen Space Dogs, temporal attributes may be used for quantatitive.
    * If chosen Burritos, the lat/long coordinates based on the address for the quantitative attribute. 
* Not required to visualize _all_ of the given data. Focused on a specific topic or question that I want to address, and therefore might only need to look at a subset of the data (attributes or items) to answer it.
* One approach for creating a unique visualization is to create custom glyphs. Here are some examples that can provide inspiration.
